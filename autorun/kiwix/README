Procedure to compile your own version of kiwix autorun. 
This general procedure is to compile the autorun kiwix (launcher). 
It's been done in c + + with Qt libraries.

-Requeriments:

* mingw32.
* qt 4.x.x.
* msys could be necesary. 

Also you can install individually minGW and qt. If you don't need the complete SDK? 
Download source packages of the Qt framework only (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp)

-Manually:

1) Make sure you have MinGW installed. Please, download MinGW from (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated MinGW Installer/)
2) Download the file qt-win-opensource-desktop-4.X.X.exe from (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp).
3) Open a cmd and cd to the directory c:\qt\4.X.X.
4) Run the configure program like this. Run "configure" on qt folder. Example: "C:\Qt\2010.01\qt>configure"
5) Run mingw32-make. Note: that this step takes quite some time.
6) Ensure that the MinGW bin directory and qt bin directory is in your PATH environment variable.
   PATH can be extended through "Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment variables".

-Automatic:

1) Install qt 2010.01 (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp).
2) qt 2010 don't have mcos library. Please copy mcos from the non sdk version (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp).

-Compile kiwix launcher:

1) Load cmd and cd to autorun folder.
2) Run qmake (Ensure that the autorun.pro file is in your actual dir).
3) Run "mingw32-make" from cmd or "make" from msys (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.11.exe)
   There have been some problems to compile g++ from msdos. We recommend using msys.
